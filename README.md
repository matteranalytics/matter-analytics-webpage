# Data Freelancer Portfolio Website

## Project

Here’s what I want to develop for the group:

- Create an updated version of this template: <https://github.com/codewithsadee/vcard-personal-portfolio> — tailored for data freelancers.
- Change the style to something similar to this: <https://dataplustemplate.webflow.io/home-pages/home-v1> — to make it more “tech”
- There is a style-guide as well: <https://dataplustemplate.webflow.io/template-pages/style-guide>
- I only want to take the colors, fonts, and shadows from the example. So we don’t have to redesign any of the elements.
- Update the icons to match the new style — <https://www.flaticon.com/>
- Template should be fully responsible for all devices

The final result should be a template that can easily be copied by new members with some instructions to create their website and published using GitHub pages.

Although yesterday you mentioned another service so that we can keep the repo private? Would love to learn more about that as well.

## Colors

- Try to match the look and feel from the [BRIX template](https://dataplustemplate.webflow.io/template-pages/style-guide).
- Only use the gradient color in the “bars”. Use single colors for all other elements.
- The vCard template currently has a lot of color codes. Please try to make this simpler so the user can easily change the colors.

## Pages

We can basically keep everything the same and only remove some items (please see below). The only new thing is the portfolio item page so you can actually click to portfolio items. You can use my info/text where possible: <https://daveebbelaar.github.io/> and otherwise use placeholder text.

- Sidebar (same, but remove birthday)
  - add GitHub link
  - add LinkedIn link
- About (same)
- Intro (same)
- What I’m Doing (same, but update logos)
- Testimonials (same, but remove memoijs)
- Clients (same)
- Resume (same)
- Portfolio (same)
  - Portfolio item (new)
  - Make it so that the portfolio items actually links to a page.
  - Portfolio items should have
    - Title
    - Category
    - Image
    - Client
    - Then the content itself (just headers + help text). I want the design to look similar to this: <https://dataplustemplate.webflow.io/career/head-of-inbound-marketing>
      - So this will be the actual content of the page:
      - Project Overview
        - A brief introduction to the project
        - Objective(s) and the problem(s) addressed
        - Client's requirements and goals (if applicable)
      - Tools and Technologies Used
        - List software, programming languages, and tools used in the project
      - Project Process and Methodology
        - A step-by-step breakdown of the project workflow, including data collection, analysis, modeling, and visualization
        - Use bullet points or numbered lists for easy readability
        - Optional: Include visual aids such as flowcharts, diagrams, or process maps to illustrate the workflow
      - Results and Impact
        - Quantitative and qualitative outcomes of the project
        - Key insights and findings
        - Client testimonials or feedback (if applicable)
        - Optional: Use visualizations, charts, or graphs to support the results
- Blog (remove)
- Contact (remove)
