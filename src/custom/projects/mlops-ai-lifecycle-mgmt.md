# MLOps & AI Lifecycle Management

---

## Overview
MLOps & AI Lifecycle Management provides end-to-end oversight of model development and deployment. By automating testing, integration, and monitoring, organizations can maintain high-performing models and adapt quickly to changing data or requirements.

## Key Capabilities
- Automated Model Testing & Version Control  
- CI/CD Pipelines for AI Solutions  
- Model Monitoring, Drift Detection & Alerts  
- Infrastructure as Code (Docker, Kubernetes, etc.)

## Approach

- **Phase 1: Data Assessment (DAS)**  
  Evaluate your data environment and plan how models will be refreshed, retrained, or replaced. Identify infrastructure requirements for automated processes.

- **Phase 2: Proof of Concept (PoC)**  
  Implement a pilot CI/CD pipeline for at least one AI model. Validate continuous integration, deployment, and monitoring workflows.

- **Phase 3: Production (Prod)**  
  Roll out full-scale pipelines and integrate models with production systems. Ensure real-time performance tracking, resource scaling, and robust model governance.

- **Optional CI/CD**  
  By design, MLOps is CI/CD-centric. We provide ongoing maintenance and on-call support to keep pipelines, models, and infrastructure running at peak efficiency.

## Example Use Cases
- **Realtime Model Updates**: Automated deployment of new model versions, or updated tables.  
- **Scheduled Retraining**: Ongoing pipeline refreshing models on updated datasets.  
- **Scalable Infrastructure**: Leveraging Kubernetes or Docker for high-volume, low-latency automation & predictions.
